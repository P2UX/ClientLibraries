# Application Bundle Updates
---
One of the benefits of using P2UX application bundles is its ability to update the application content without having to update the native application binary. Application bundles used by native applications can be updated in a few different ways.

## Auto Update
Each time the application is restarted by the user, the *PRL* will compare the version of the application bundle it has against the version for the specified environment on *Builder*.
